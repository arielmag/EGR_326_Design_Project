# EGR 326 Embedded System Design & Build Project

## Introduction
In the fast growing world today, the technology has become a critical element in oneâ€™s daily life.
With the technological advancement, the need for a better, more user friendly home security has
been realized by many. The purposes of this embedded system are to design, built and develop a
home security system, that allows various user interfaces, provide various real time information
through Real Time Clock (RTC) along with sensors, and a control system. The system will be
built upon the idea of low cost and user friendly to maximize its market targets. To achieve this
goal, the system was designed with the microcontroller MSP432, a 32-bit ARM microcontroller
that significantly lowers the cost of the system, yet it is absolutely powerful enough to allow the
embedded system to achieve the requirements.
